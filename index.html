<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
      <h1>Hey there!</h1>

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a second-year Electrical Engineering major with a minor in Materials Science. Many engineers would consider this a weird combo, but I have a special interest in advanced 3D printing and solar technology, which both fields heavily overlap in. I am taking this course as a professional development requirement for the Swanson School of Engineering. I could've taken an economics class, but I much prefer art and design.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

  <h2>About Me and My Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>I have (and historically have had) a LOT of weird hobbies. In highschool, I customized fashion dolls, grew oyster mushrooms in my bedroom, and participated in stage crew because I was one of the few students my tech teacher trusted with a power tool. Currently, I like building electronic projects from scratch, sewing fursuits, and 3D printing. Overall, I have always enjoyed creating things. I hope this class will allow my creations to be more effective in communicating what I want.</h3>
  <h3>Besides my creative hobbies, I'm a complete gym bro and will always be caught drinking too much preworkout. I have a cat named Moka; he is so so silly and I love him so much.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>Effective design is attention-grabbing, easy to comprehend, and clearly communicated the message you're trying to get across -- whether that be social, commercial, political, or creative. I usually design out of a love for art, so I focus on the latter. I want my art and creative projects to be flashy and fun, but not too busy to be difficult to comprehend (unless confusion is the desired emotion I'm trying to evoke). Good design is completely dependent on the purpose of the design.</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After completing my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at Pitt, I hope to go straight into industry in a creative or advanced manufacturing field. I'm not completely sure what I want to specialize in yet, but some ideas I've considered include improving 3D printed solar cells or designing accessibility devices that are fun and functional. Whatever I do, I just want to create. I hope this class will give me a good basis in effective communication and design, so that I can be a better creative.</h3>
